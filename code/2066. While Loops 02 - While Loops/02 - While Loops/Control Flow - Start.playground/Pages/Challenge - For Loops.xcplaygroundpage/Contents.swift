/*:
 Create a constant called range and set it equal to a range starting at 1 and ending with 10 inclusive. Write a for loop which iterates over this range and prints the square of each number.

// TODO: Write solution here


/*:
 The code below iterates over only even rows. Change this to use a where clause on the first for loop to skip even rows instead of using continue. Check that the sum is still 448 after your modifications.
