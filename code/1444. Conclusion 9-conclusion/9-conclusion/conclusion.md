# Conclusion

In this section we have built an accompanying web application to sit alongside our API so that users can view, create and edit acronyms from a browser. Though we haven't completely replicated everything, you should now understand everything you need if you want extra bonus points to implement things like search and add categories to our acronyms in Leaf.

[Slide 1]

You have learnt how to use Leaf to generate HTML pages from templates that can be used in the browser. You've build a fully-fledged web application that performs many of the same tasks as our API, but looks a bit nicer and is easier for users to use!

You learnt how to integrate the Bootstrap framework to provide quick and easy styling to your application. Finally you learnt how to accept data from web forms being sent from the browser.

[Slide 2]

In the next section we are going to look at Authentication and how to protect certain routes so that they can only be accessed by known users.

We are going to learn how to implement a both a basic authentication based system and a token based authentication system for our API and how to use sessions and cookies so web users can log in and create and edit acronyms.
