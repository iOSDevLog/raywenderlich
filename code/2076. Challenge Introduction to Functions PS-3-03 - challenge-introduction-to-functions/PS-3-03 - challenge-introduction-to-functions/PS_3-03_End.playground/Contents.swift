 ### INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS
 
 Write a function named `printFullName` that takes two strings called `firstName` and `lastName`.  The function should print out the full name defined as `firstName` + " " + `lastName`. Use it to print out your own full name.
 */
 
 
 func printFullName(_ firstName: String, _ lastName: String) {
 print(firstName + " " + lastName)
 }
 //printFullName(firstName: "Catie", lastName: "Catterwaul")
 printFullName("Jessy", "Catterwaul")


/*:
 Change the declaration of `printFullName` to have no argument label for either parameter.
 */
 
 
/*:
 Write a function named `calculateFullName` that returns the full name as a string. Use it to store your own full name in a constant.
 */
 
 
 func calculateFullName(_ firstName: String, _ lastName: String) -> String {
 return firstName + " " + lastName

/*:
 Change `calculateFullName` to return a tuple containing both the full name and the length of the name. You can find a stringâ€™s length by using the `count` property. Use this function to determine the length of your own full name.
 */
