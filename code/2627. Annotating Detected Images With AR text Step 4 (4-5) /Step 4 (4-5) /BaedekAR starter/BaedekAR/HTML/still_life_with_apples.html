    <h1>Still Life with Apples</h1>
    <p>Still lifes are works of art that feature mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects are either natural (food and flowers are popular) or human-made.</p>
    <p><em>Wikipedia</em> says: “With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greco-Roman art, still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century, and has remained significant since then. A still-life form gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture.”</p>
