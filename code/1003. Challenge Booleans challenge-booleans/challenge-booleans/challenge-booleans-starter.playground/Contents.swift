 Create a constant called `myAge` and set it to your age. Then, create a constant called `isTeenager` that uses Boolean logic to determine if the age denotes someone in the age range of 13 to 19.
 */
 
// TODO: Write solution here

/*:
 Create another constant called `theirAge` and set it to the age of the author of these challenges (tutorial team member Matt Galloway), which is 30. Then, create a constant called `bothTeenagers` that uses Boolean logic to determine if both you and him are teenagers.

/*:
 Create a constant called student and set it to your name as a string. Create a constant called author and set it to Matt Galloway. Create a constant called `authorIsStudent` that uses string equality to determine if student and author are equal.

/*:
 Create a constant called `studentBeforeAuthor` which uses string comparison to determine if student comes before author.

 ### IF STATEMENTS AND BOOLEANS
 Create a constant called `myAge` and initialize it with your age. Write an if statement to print out Teenager if your age is between 13 and 19, and Not a teenager if your age is not between 13 and 19.
