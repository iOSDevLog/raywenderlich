 # Demo 3

 This demo walks you through adding pull to refresh to the settings screen while continuing to build on the unidirectional architecture from Demo 2.

 So far, the settings screen just renders the initial state, i.e. whatever user profile happens to be stored in persistent store. The architecture isn't very useful if you can't do things like reload data from the network.

 - Important:
 Before starting, make sure to build the **ReSwift-iOS** target and the **RxSwift-iOS** target for any simulator. This is needed so that this playground can import both libraries.
