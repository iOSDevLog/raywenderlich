 # Demo 2

 This demo walks you through adding persistence while continuing to build on the unidirectional architecture from Demo 1.

 So far, the settings screen just renders the initial empty state.

 - Important:
 Before starting, make sure to build the **ReSwift-iOS** target and the **RxSwift-iOS** target for any simulator. This is needed so that this playground can import both libraries.
