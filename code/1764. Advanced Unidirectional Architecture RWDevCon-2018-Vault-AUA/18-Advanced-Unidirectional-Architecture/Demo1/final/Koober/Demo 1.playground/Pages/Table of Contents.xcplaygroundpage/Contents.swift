 This demo covers how to combine unidirectional data-flow with reactive streams in order to design a flexible data access architecture.

 - Important:
 Before starting, make sure to build the **ReSwift-iOS** target and the **RxSwift-iOS** target for any simulator. This is needed so that this playground can import both libraries.
