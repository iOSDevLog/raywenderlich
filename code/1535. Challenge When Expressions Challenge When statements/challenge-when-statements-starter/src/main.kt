 Infant; 3-12 years, Child; 13-19 years, Teenager; 20-39, Adult;40-60, Middle aged; 61+, Elderly.
 */


/*
 Write a when statement that takes a pair containing a string and an integer.
 The string is a name, and the integer is an age. Use the same cases that you used
 in the previous exercise and println out the name followed by the life stage.
 For example, for the author of these challenges, it would println out "Kevin is middle aged.".
