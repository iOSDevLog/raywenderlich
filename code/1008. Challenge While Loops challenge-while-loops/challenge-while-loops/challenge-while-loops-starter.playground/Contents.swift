 ### WHILE LOOPS
 Create a variable named `counter` and set it equal to 0. Create a `while` loop with the condition `counter < 10` which prints out `counter` is `X` (where `X` is replaced with counter value) and then increments `counter` by 1.

/*:
 Create a variable named counter and set it equal to 0. Create another variable named roll and set it equal to 0. Create a repeat-while loop. Inside the loop, set roll equal to Int(arc4random_uniform(6)) which means to pick a random number between 0 and 5. Then increment counter by 1. Finally, print After X rolls, roll is Y where X is the value of counter and Y is the value of roll. Set the loop condition such that the loop finishes when the first 0 is rolled.
