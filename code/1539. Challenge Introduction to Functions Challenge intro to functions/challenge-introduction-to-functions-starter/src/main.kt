 ### BASIC Functions
 
 Write a funtion named `printFullName` that takes two strings called `firstName` and `lastName`.  
 The funtion should print out the full name defined as `firstName` + " " + `lastName`. 
 Use it to print out your own full name using the parameter names.
 */

    // Your solution Here

/*
 Use the printFullName function without any parameter names.
 */

    // Your solution Here

/*
Write a funtion named `calculateFullName` that returns the full name as a string.
Use it to store your own full name in a constant and then print it.
*/

    // Your solution Here

/*
 Create `calculateFullNameWithLength` to return a pair containing both the full name and the
 length of the name. You can find a stringâ€™s length by using the following
 syntax: `string.length`. Use this funtion to determine the length
 of your own full name. Then print out the result of the function.
