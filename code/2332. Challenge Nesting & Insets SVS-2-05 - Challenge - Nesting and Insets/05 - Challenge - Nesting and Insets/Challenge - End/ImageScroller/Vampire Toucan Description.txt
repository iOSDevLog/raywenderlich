The Vampire Toucan is a mysterious species of toucan found in the darkest rainforests of the Amazon.  This toucan gets its name from its jagged red-edged bill, which resembles bloodied teeth.  

It is also much more likely to seek out lizards or even small birds for dinner than its more fruit-loving toucan cousins.  It is not very adept at flying, and is more likely to be spotted hopping from tree to tree.  

The male Vampire Toucan is distinguished by an enormous flowing tail and an elaborate crest essential to successful mating displays.  Mating season may be the only time these birds see one another, as this particular type of toucan is largely solitary.
