 Write a switch statement that takes an age as an integer and assigns the life stage related to that age, to a `String`. You can make up the life stages, or use our categorization as follows:
 * 0-2 years: Infant
 * 3-12 years: Child
 * 13-19 years: Teenager
 * 20-39: Adult
 * 40-60: Middle aged
 * 61+: Elderly

 Write a switch statement that takes a tuple containing a `String` and an `Int`.  The `String` is a name, and the `Int` is an age. Use the same cases that you used above, and binding with `let` syntax, to assign the the name, followed by the life stage, to a `String` constant. For example, for the author of these challenges, you'd assign "Matt is an adult." to your constant.
