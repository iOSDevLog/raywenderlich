 ### INTRODUCTION TO OPTIONALS
 
 Make an optional `String` called `myFavoriteSong`. If you have a favorite song, set it to a string representing that song. If you have more than one favorite song or no favorite, set the optional to `nil`.
 */

// TODO: Write solution here

/*:
 Create a constant called `parsedInt` and set it equal to `Int("10")` which tries to parse the string `10` and convert it to an `Int`. Check the type of `parsedInt` using Option-Click. Why is it an optional?
 */

// TODO: Write solution here

/*:
 Change the string being parsed in the above exercise to a non-integer (try "dog" for example). What does `parsedInt` equal now?
