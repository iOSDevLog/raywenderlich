 # The View Controllers

 ## Settings View Controller
 The settings view controller is the primary controller you will be working on. You will build this view controller from scratch and see how to deliver the settings view state from a redux store to the view controller via RxSwift observables.


 ## Home View Controller
 The home view controller presents the settings view controller and creates and holds on to a dependency container.
