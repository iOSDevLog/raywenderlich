  <h1>Boat on Beach</h1>
  <p>Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Shields up! Rrrrred alert!</p>
  <p>I'll be sure to note that in my log. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Not if I weaken first. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I am your worst nightmare! Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.</p>
