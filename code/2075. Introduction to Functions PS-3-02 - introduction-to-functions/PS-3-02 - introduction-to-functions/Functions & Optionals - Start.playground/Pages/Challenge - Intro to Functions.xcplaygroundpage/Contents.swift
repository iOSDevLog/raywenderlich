/*:

/*:
 Write a function named `calculateFullName` that returns the full name as a string. Use it to store your own full name in a constant.
 */


// TODO: Write solution here


/*:
 Change `calculateFullName` to return a tuple containing both the full name and the length of the name. You can find a stringâ€™s length by using the `count` property. Use this function to determine the length of your own full name.
