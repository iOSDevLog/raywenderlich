//: Very much like traditional `dispatch_async()`




//: ## Notification of group completion
//: Will be called only when everything in that dispatch group is completed




//: ## Waiting for a group to complete
//: __DANGER__ This is synchronous and can block
//: This is a synchronous call on the current queue, so will block it. You cannot have anything in the group that wants to use the current queue otherwise you'll block.

//: All well and good for new APIs, but there are lots of async APIs that don't have group parameters. What can you do with them?
